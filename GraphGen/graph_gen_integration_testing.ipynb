Standardized quiz bowl formats are played by primary school, middle school, high school, and university students throughout North America, Asia, Europe, Australia, and Africa.[2]\n",
    "\n",
    "Quiz bowl competitions are typically played with a lockout buzzer system[1] between at least two teams, usually consisting of four players each. A moderator reads questions to the players, who try to score points for their team by buzzing first and responding with the correct answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "Quiz bowl is most commonly played in a toss-up/bonus format, which consists of a series of two different types of questions. Other formats, particularly in local competitions, may deviate from the above rules, with additions like lightning rounds or category choice.[3]\n",
    "\n",
    "Most forms of modern quiz bowl are modeled after game shows.[4] College Bowl, which was created by Don Reid as a USO activity for U.S. service men during World War II, was an influential early quiz bowl program.[5][6] Also known as \"The College Quiz Bowl,\" it started on radio in 1953 and then aired on national television in the U.S. from 1959 to 1970.[7]\n",
    "\n",
    "In the first half of the 20th century, many other quiz-bowl-like competitions were also created. Delco Hi-Q began in 1948 as a radio quiz competition sponsored by the Scott Paper Company for high school students in Delaware County, Pennsylvania. It claims to be the oldest continuously running student quiz contest in the United States.[8] The It's Academic televised student quiz show program has been run for high school teams in the Washington, D.C., metropolitan area since 1961 and is recognized by the Guinness Book of World Records as the longest-running quiz program in television history.[9] It's Academic has been spun off in many other U.S. media markets and has inspired many other televised high school competitions.[9]\n",
    "\n",
    "In 1977, College Bowl was revived as an activity on college campuses in the U.S. by College Bowl Company Inc. (CBCI).[10] In September 1990, the Academic Competition Federation (ACF) was founded as the first major alternative to The College Bowl Company.[11] National Academic Quiz Tournaments (NAQT) was founded in 1996 and currently organizes national competitions at all levels in the United States and supplies tournament questions for grade school and college teams across North America and other parts of the world.[12][13] In 2008, the College Bowl program abruptly ended in the U.S., although the company itself continues to operate the Honda Campus All-Star Challenge (HCASC) for historically black colleges and universities.[14] \n",
